      <h2>3. Past Cybersecurity Attacks</h2>
  <p>Let me know if we have any questions about this material. I'm here to help!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Overview:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The security industry is constantly evolving, but many present-day attacks are adaptations of earlier methods.</li>
        <li>Understanding past attacks helps security analysts investigate and handle incidents effectively.</li>
        <li>A <em>computer virus</em> is malicious code designed to disrupt computer operations and damage data/software.</li>
        <li>Viruses attach to programs or documents and spread across computers in a network.</li>
        <li>Today, viruses are often called <em>malware</em>, which broadly means software designed to harm devices or networks.</li>
        <li>Two early malware examples are the <strong>Brain virus</strong> and the <strong>Morris worm</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The Brain Virus (1986):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Created by the Alvi brothers to track illegal medical software copies and prevent piracy.</li>
        <li>Instead of just tracking, it infected computers using pirated software.</li>
        <li>Infection spread through any disk inserted into an infected computer, rapidly spreading globally.</li>
        <li>Although it did not aim to destroy data or hardware, it slowed productivity and impacted business operations.</li>
        <li>This virus emphasized the need for security plans to maintain data safety and productivity.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The Morris Worm (1988):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed by Robert Morris to assess the size of the internet by installing itself on connected computers.</li>
        <li>The worm failed to track compromised computers and kept reinstalling itself, causing crashes due to memory exhaustion.</li>
        <li>About 6,000 computers (10% of the internet then) were affected.</li>
        <li>The attack caused millions in damages from business disruption and removal efforts.</li>
        <li>Resulted in the creation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs®), which respond to security incidents.</li>
        <li>CERTs have since expanded responsibilities in the security industry.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Summary:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Early attacks like these shaped current cybersecurity strategies.</li>
        <li>Later topics in this program will cover the evolution of attacks in the digital age and hands-on detection and response skills.</li>
      </ul>

  <p>Let me know if we have any questions about this material. I'm here to help!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet Expansion and Malware Spread:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>With reliable high-speed internet, the number of connected computers increased dramatically.</li>
        <li>Malware no longer needed physical disks to spread; it could propagate through the internet.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Notable Internet-Based Attacks:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>LoveLetter Attack (2000):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Created by Onel De Guzman to steal internet login credentials.</li>
            <li>Spread rapidly by exploiting users' lack of suspicion toward unsolicited emails.</li>
            <li>Emails had subject line "I Love we" with an attachment "Love Letter For we."</li>
            <li>Opening the attachment caused the malware to scan the user’s address book and send itself to all contacts.</li>
            <li>Installed a program to collect user info and passwords.</li>
            <li>Infected 45 million computers globally, causing over $10 billion in damages.</li>
            <li>First notable example of <em>social engineering</em>.</li>
          </ul>

            <li>Employees commonly receive training to recognize social engineering attacks, especially phishing emails.</li>
            <li><em>Phishing</em> uses digital communications to trick individuals into revealing sensitive data or deploying malware.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Equifax Breach (2017):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Attackers infiltrated credit reporting agency Equifax.</li>
            <li>Stole over 143 million customer records, affecting ~40% of Americans.</li>
            <li>Compromised data included social security numbers, birth dates, driver’s license numbers, home addresses, credit card numbers.</li>
            <li>Breach resulted from multiple unpatched vulnerabilities ignored by Equifax.</li>
            <li>Equifax settled with the U.S. government, paying over $575 million for complaints and fines.</li>
            <li>This major settlement highlighted the financial consequences of breaches and emphasized preventative measures.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Summary and Future Outlook:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>These well-known incidents shaped the security industry.</li>
        <li>Knowledge of malware and social engineering is valuable for communication about security risks, including job interviews.</li>
        <li>Security professionals must continuously adapt to new threat tactics and techniques.</li>

  <p>An <strong>asset</strong> is any item perceived to have value to an organization. Its value is often determined by its associated cost or impact. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An application storing sensitive data like social security numbers or bank accounts is a high-value asset and requires stringent security.</li>
    <li>A website sharing public news content is a low-risk asset and may not need the same level of protection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)</h3>
  <p>The <strong>NIST Cybersecurity Framework</strong> is a voluntary guideline developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. It includes standards and best practices for managing cybersecurity risk. Organizations use it to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Establish a baseline for security practices</li>
    <li>Manage short-term and long-term risks</li>
    <li>Align controls with organizational goals and threats</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Security teams often consider the motives of threat actors, such as disgruntled employees who may already have access to sensitive information. To mitigate this risk, professionals apply the principle of availability and enforce strict access guidelines—ensuring individuals only access what they need for their role.</p>

  <h3>Global Threats & Diverse Teams</h3>
  <p>Threat actors originate from across the globe. A diverse workforce helps bring varied perspectives, which enhances an organization’s ability to detect and mitigate attacks.</p>

  <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
  <p>The CIA Triad and NIST CSF are foundational tools used to secure systems, data, and users. Understanding these principles is essential in both job interviews and real-world scenarios.</p>

  </div>




   <div class="glow-box" id="ethics">
  <h2>8. Ethics in Cybersecurity</h2>

  <p>Ethics in cybersecurity guide professionals to make the right decisions when facing security incidents, even when the choices are not clear-cut. As a security analyst, maintaining integrity, confidentiality, and adherence to policies is crucial, regardless of personal relationships or temptations.</p>

  <h3>Ethical Responsibilities of Security Professionals</h3>
  <p>Security professionals often have privileged access to sensitive data and systems. This access comes with the ethical duty to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remain unbiased and objective when investigating incidents.</li>
    <li>Protect confidentiality and avoid misuse of sensitive information.</li>
    <li>Follow organizational policies and protocols without favoritism.</li>
    <li>Avoid abusing access privileges, such as self-granting raises or unauthorized data access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Ethical Principles in Cybersecurity</h3>

  <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
  <p>Confidentiality means safeguarding proprietary and private information, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Security professionals must ensure this data is not disclosed inappropriately. For example, granting system access to coworkers outside of official channels is unethical and may result in severe consequences.</p>

  <h4>Privacy Protections</h4>
  <p>Privacy involves protecting personal information from unauthorized use. Security staff must adhere strictly to company policies regarding data access and sharing. Even when pressured, such as receiving after-hours requests for employee information, the correct response is to follow documented procedures, not circumvent them.</p>

  <h4>Laws and Compliance</h4>
  <p>Legal obligations are a fundamental part of cybersecurity ethics. Negligence or failure to protect sensitive data can lead to violations of compliance regulations and legal penalties. For example, leaving confidential patient files unattended is both unethical and illegal, risking data loss and reputational damage.</p>

  <h3>Why Ethics Matter in Cybersecurity</h3>
  <p>As technologies evolve and threats become more sophisticated, ethical decision-making ensures security professionals respond appropriately and protect organizational and individual interests.

  </div>




   <div class="glow-box" id="n">
      <h2>8.1 Ethical Concepts That Guide Cybersecurity Decisions</h2> 
     <p>Building on the foundation of security ethics, cybersecurity professionals must use ethical principles to make informed and responsible decisions. Ethics help ensure that actions taken to protect organizations and people are legal, fair, and effective in the face of evolving threats.</p> 
     <h3>Ethical Concerns and Laws Around Counterattacks</h3> 
     <h4>United States Standpoint</h4> 
     <p>In the U.S., launching counterattacks against threat actors is illegal under laws such as the <em>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1986)</em> and the <em>Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (2015)</em>. Only defensive actions are legally permitted. Counterattacks are viewed as vigilantism—unauthorized attempts to enforce the law—which can escalate conflicts, cause additional harm, and have severe consequences, especially if the attacker is a state-sponsored hacktivist. Only approved federal or military personnel can conduct counterattacks.</p> 
     <h4>International Standpoint</h4> 
     <p>The <em>International Court of Justice (ICJ)</em> permits counterattacks only under strict conditions:</p> 
     <ul> 
       <li>The counterattack affects only the original attacker.</li> 
       <li>It serves as a direct communication demanding the attacker stop.</li> 
       <li>It does not escalate the conflict.</li> 
       <li>Its effects can be reversed.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>Because these conditions are difficult to verify, organizations generally avoid counterattacks due to legal ambiguity and the risk of worsening the situation. 
     <h3>Core Ethical Principles and Methodologies</h3> 
       <p>Since counterattacks are mostly disallowed or illegal, cybersecurity relies on frameworks such as the <strong>CIA triad</strong> to address ethical obligations. These include:</p> 
     <h4>Confidentiality</h4> 
     <p>Ensuring that only authorized users access sensitive data. Ethically, this means respecting privacy and safeguarding private assets.</p> 
     <h4>Privacy Protection</h4> 
     <p>Protecting personal information—including <strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong> and <strong>Sensitive PII (SPII)</strong>—from unauthorized use. Security professionals have an ethical duty to secure such data, identify vulnerabilities, manage risks, and align security efforts with organizational goals.</p> 
     <h4>Laws and Legal Compliance</h4> 
     <p>Cybersecurity professionals must:</p> 
     <ul> 
       <li>Remain unbiased and honest in their work.</li> 
       <li>Respect and uphold laws applicable to data and security.</li>
       <li>Be transparent, evidence-based, and just in decision-making.</li> 
       <li>Continuously update skills and knowledge to better serve the cyber ecosystem.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>For example, compliance with the <strong>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</strong> requires protecting patients’ health information and notifying them if a breach occurs.</p> 
     <h3>Key Takeaways</h3> 
     <p>Understanding and applying ethical concepts and laws are essential for cybersecurity professionals to navigate threats responsibly, protect their organizations, and maintain trust in their work.</p>

      <h2>10.1 Use Tools to Protect Business Operations</h2>

  <p>Cybersecurity professionals use a wide range of tools, programming languages, and operating systems to protect systems and data. As an entry-level analyst, understanding the purpose and function of these tools will help you contribute effectively to your organization's security operations.</p>

  <h3>Programming</h3>
  <p>Programming allows analysts to automate repetitive tasks, reducing human error and increasing efficiency. Languages like Python are used to create scripts that perform automated checks, process data, and manage system behavior. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to extract specific data points from large databases, allowing analysts to identify trends, filter information, and support investigations.</p>

  <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
  <p>Operating systems (OS) act as intermediaries between users and computer hardware. Common OS options include Linux, macOS, and Windows. Linux, in particular, is favored in cybersecurity due to its open-source nature and command-line interface, which enables advanced system control and log analysis. You'll explore Linux in greater detail later in the program, including its kernel and the GNU components that support it.</p>

  <h3>Web Vulnerabilities</h3>
  <p>Web vulnerabilities are flaws in web applications that can be exploited by threat actors to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or deploy malware. Staying updated with common vulnerabilities is critical. The <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OWASP Top 10</a> is a key resource for understanding current web application security risks.</p>

  <h3>Antivirus Software</h3>
  <p>Antivirus, or anti-malware software, detects, prevents, and removes malicious software. These tools scan system memory for patterns associated with malware and help protect against infections that can compromise system integrity.</p>

  <h3>Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</h3>
  <p>An IDS monitors network traffic for suspicious behavior or unauthorized access attempts. By analyzing packets of data moving through the network, an IDS can alert analysts to potential threats such as intrusions or data theft.</p>

  <h3>Encryption</h3>
  <p>Encryption protects the confidentiality of data by converting readable information (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext). This ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be understood by unauthorized users. Encryption differs from encoding, which uses public algorithms to allow different systems to share information without focusing on security.</p>

  <h3>Penetration Testing</h3>
  <p>Penetration testing, or pen testing, is a simulated cyberattack conducted to identify vulnerabilities in systems, applications, or processes. Pen testing evaluates both internal and external threats, helping organizations strengthen their defenses before real attacks occur.</p>

  <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
  <p>In this reading, you explored programming, operating systems, and a variety of tools used by security analysts. Each organization selects the tools that align with its security goals, so developing familiarity with a broad set of tools increases your versatility and value in the field.</p>

      <h2>11. Create a Cybersecurity Portfolio</h2>

  <p>Throughout this certificate program, you'll have opportunities to build a professional cybersecurity portfolio to showcase your skills, projects, and knowledge. A strong portfolio can demonstrate your readiness for cybersecurity roles and help you stand out to potential employers.</p>

  <h3>What Is a Portfolio and Why Is It Important?</h3>
  <p>A portfolio is a collection of work that demonstrates your capabilities in cybersecurity. Unlike a resume—which summarizes education and experience in one or two pages—a portfolio offers a deeper view into what you’ve learned and accomplished. Portfolios reflect your passion, initiative, and practical experience, making them valuable when applying for jobs. You’ll also create a resume and finalize your portfolio during the final course of this program.</p>

  <h3>Options for Creating Your Portfolio</h3>
  <p>You can organize your cybersecurity portfolio in several ways, ranging from simple folders to hosted online sites. Here are four common options:</p>

  <h4>1. Documents Folder</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong> A local folder on your computer where you store documents, images, and other portfolio items. You manage the file structure and content manually.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Setup:</strong> Create a main folder titled something like “Professional Documents,” and include subfolders like:
    <ul>
      <li>Resume</li>
      <li>Education</li>
      <li>Portfolio Documents</li>
      <li>Cybersecurity Tools</li>
      <li>Programming</li>
    </ul>
    Search online for instructions specific to your computer’s operating system if you're unsure how to create folders.
  </p>

  <h4>2. Google Drive or Dropbox</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong> Cloud-based storage platforms that let you save and organize your portfolio online. You can also share files with potential employers, and any updates are automatically reflected for shared users.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Setup:</strong> Visit the Google Drive or Dropbox websites to learn how to upload, organize, and share files effectively.
  </p>

  <h4>3. Google Sites</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong> A free website builder that allows you to design and publish a customizable portfolio site. It supports responsive layouts, embedded files, and multimedia content.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Setup:</strong> Use Google Sites to build your site and publish it to receive a custom URL. This link can be included on your resume for easy access to your work. Learn more at the Google Sites website.
  </p>

  <h4>4. Git Repository</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong> Git repositories allow you to version-control and share your work. Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket let you organize scripts, lab results, documents, and screenshots using Markdown formatting.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Setup:</strong> Create a GitHub account and explore Markdown to format your repository. Follow the steps in the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get started with GitHub</a> guide to begin.
  </p>

  <h3>Portfolio Projects</h3>
  <p>Throughout this program, you’ll build content to include in your portfolio, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A professional statement</li>
    <li>Security audit reports</li>
