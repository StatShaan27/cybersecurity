      <h2>Past Cybersecurity Attacks</h2>
  <p>Let me know if we have any questions about this material. I'm here to help!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Overview:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The security industry is constantly evolving, but many present-day attacks are adaptations of earlier methods.</li>
        <li>Understanding past attacks helps security analysts investigate and handle incidents effectively.</li>
        <li>A <em>computer virus</em> is malicious code designed to disrupt computer operations and damage data/software.</li>
        <li>Viruses attach to programs or documents and spread across computers in a network.</li>
        <li>Today, viruses are often called <em>malware</em>, which broadly means software designed to harm devices or networks.</li>
        <li>Two early malware examples are the <strong>Brain virus</strong> and the <strong>Morris worm</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The Brain Virus (1986):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Created by the Alvi brothers to track illegal medical software copies and prevent piracy.</li>
        <li>Instead of just tracking, it infected computers using pirated software.</li>
        <li>Infection spread through any disk inserted into an infected computer, rapidly spreading globally.</li>
        <li>Although it did not aim to destroy data or hardware, it slowed productivity and impacted business operations.</li>
        <li>This virus emphasized the need for security plans to maintain data safety and productivity.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The Morris Worm (1988):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed by Robert Morris to assess the size of the internet by installing itself on connected computers.</li>
        <li>The worm failed to track compromised computers and kept reinstalling itself, causing crashes due to memory exhaustion.</li>
        <li>About 6,000 computers (10% of the internet then) were affected.</li>
        <li>The attack caused millions in damages from business disruption and removal efforts.</li>
        <li>Resulted in the creation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs®), which respond to security incidents.</li>
        <li>CERTs have since expanded responsibilities in the security industry.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Summary:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Early attacks like these shaped current cybersecurity strategies.</li>
        <li>Later topics in this program will cover the evolution of attacks in the digital age and hands-on detection and response skills.</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="glow-box" id="n">
      <h2>Attacks in the Digital Age</h2>
  <p>Let me know if we have any questions about this material. I'm here to help!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet Expansion and Malware Spread:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>With reliable high-speed internet, the number of connected computers increased dramatically.</li>
        <li>Malware no longer needed physical disks to spread; it could propagate through the internet.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Notable Internet-Based Attacks:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>LoveLetter Attack (2000):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Created by Onel De Guzman to steal internet login credentials.</li>
            <li>Spread rapidly by exploiting users' lack of suspicion toward unsolicited emails.</li>
            <li>Emails had subject line "I Love we" with an attachment "Love Letter For we."</li>
            <li>Opening the attachment caused the malware to scan the user’s address book and send itself to all contacts.</li>
            <li>Installed a program to collect user info and passwords.</li>
            <li>Infected 45 million computers globally, causing over $10 billion in damages.</li>
            <li>First notable example of <em>social engineering</em>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>A manipulation technique exploiting human error to gain private info, access, or valuables.</li>
            <li>After LoveLetter, attackers increasingly used social engineering.</li>
            <li>Rise of social media apps increased data accessibility and user vulnerability.</li>
            <li>Many prioritize convenience over privacy, leading to increased security risks.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Role of Security Professionals:</strong>

            <li>Identify and manage inappropriate technology use that risks the organization.</li>
            <li>Conduct and participate in regular internal trainings to raise awareness.</li>
            <li>Employees commonly receive training to recognize social engineering attacks, especially phishing emails.</li>
            <li><em>Phishing</em> uses digital communications to trick individuals into revealing sensitive data or deploying malware.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Equifax Breach (2017):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Attackers infiltrated credit reporting agency Equifax.</li>
            <li>Stole over 143 million customer records, affecting ~40% of Americans.</li>
            <li>Compromised data included social security numbers, birth dates, driver’s license numbers, home addresses, credit card numbers.</li>
            <li>Breach resulted from multiple unpatched vulnerabilities ignored by Equifax.</li>
            <li>Equifax settled with the U.S. government, paying over $575 million for complaints and fines.</li>
            <li>This major settlement highlighted the financial consequences of breaches and emphasized preventative measures.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Introduction to Security Frameworks and Controls</h2>

  <p>Imagine you're working as a <strong>security analyst</strong> and receive multiple alerts about suspicious activity on the network. You realize that you'll need to implement additional security measures to prevent these alerts from becoming serious incidents. But where do you start?</p>

  <p>As an analyst, you'll begin by identifying your organization's critical assets and risks. Then, you'll implement the necessary frameworks and controls to manage them effectively.</p>

  <h3>What Are Security Frameworks?</h3>
  <p>Security frameworks are structured guidelines that help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. They support the implementation of a <strong>security lifecycle</strong>—a continuously evolving set of standards and policies that manage risk, follow guidelines, and ensure regulatory compliance.</p>

  <p>The purposes of security frameworks include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Protecting personally identifiable information (PII)</li>
    <li>Securing financial information</li>
    <li>Identifying security weaknesses</li>
    <li>Managing organizational risks</li>
    <li>Aligning security with business goals</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Four Core Components of Security Frameworks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Identifying and Documenting Security Goals</strong><br />
      Example: Aligning with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) to ensure user data privacy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Setting Guidelines to Achieve Goals</strong><br />
      Example: Creating policies for handling data requests in compliance with GDPR.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Implementing Strong Security Processes</strong><br />
      Example: Developing procedures to verify and process user data update or deletion requests.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Monitoring and Communicating Results</strong><br />
      Example: Tracking and reporting potential GDPR-related security issues.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Security Controls</h3>
  <p>Security controls are specific safeguards designed to reduce particular risks. For example, requiring all employees to complete privacy training helps prevent data breaches. As an analyst, you may use software to assign and track training completion automatically.</p>

  <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
  <p>Security frameworks and controls are essential for managing risks in all types of organizations. Understanding how they work allows analysts to collaborate effectively, support organizational goals, and protect data and users.</p>

  </div>




   <div class="glow-box" id="n">
      <h2>Secure Design</h2>
  <h3>The CIA Triad</h3>
  <p>The <strong>CIA triad</strong> is a foundational model in cybersecurity. It represents three essential principles that guide security policies and system setup:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Only authorized users should have access to specific assets or data. Implementing strict access controls ensures that confidential data stays secure.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Data must be accurate, authentic, and reliable. Security professionals often use encryption to protect data from unauthorized changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Data must be accessible to those with proper authorization. Ensuring system uptime and avoiding disruptions are key goals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Understanding Assets</h3>
  <p>An <strong>asset</strong> is any item perceived to have value to an organization. Its value is often determined by its associated cost or impact. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An application storing sensitive data like social security numbers or bank accounts is a high-value asset and requires stringent security.</li>
    <li>A website sharing public news content is a low-risk asset and may not need the same level of protection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)</h3>
  <p>The <strong>NIST Cybersecurity Framework</strong> is a voluntary guideline developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. It includes standards and best practices for managing cybersecurity risk. Organizations use it to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Establish a baseline for security practices</li>
    <li>Manage short-term and long-term risks</li>
    <li>Align controls with organizational goals and threats</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Security teams often consider the motives of threat actors, such as disgruntled employees who may already have access to sensitive information. To mitigate this risk, professionals apply the principle of availability and enforce strict access guidelines—ensuring individuals only access what they need for their role.</p>

  <h3>Global Threats & Diverse Teams</h3>
  <p>Threat actors originate from across the globe. A diverse workforce helps bring varied perspectives, which enhances an organization’s ability to detect and mitigate attacks.</p>

  <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
  <p>The CIA Triad and NIST CSF are foundational tools used to secure systems, data, and users. Understanding these principles is essential in both job interviews and real-world scenarios.</p>

  </div>




   <div class="glow-box" id="n">
      <h2>Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance</h2>

  <p>Previously, you were introduced to security frameworks and their role in the security lifecycle. This section expands on how security frameworks, controls, and compliance regulations work together to manage organizational security and reduce risk.</p>

  <h3>Relationship Between Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance</h3>
  <p>The <strong>CIA triad</strong>—confidentiality, integrity, and availability—is a foundational model used to guide security decisions and establish appropriate controls that mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Controls</strong>: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.</li>
    <li><strong>Frameworks</strong>: Structured guidelines to implement and monitor security practices effectively.</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance</strong>: Adherence to internal standards and external regulations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Security frameworks typically consist of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identifying and documenting security goals</li>
    <li>Setting guidelines to achieve those goals</li>
    <li>Implementing strong security processes</li>
    <li>Monitoring and communicating results</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common Frameworks, Controls, and Compliance Standards</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)</strong> and <strong>Risk Management Framework (RMF)</strong>: U.S.-based voluntary standards to manage cybersecurity risk.</li>
    <li><strong>FERC-NERC</strong>: Regulatory body for power grid security; includes Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards.</li>
    <li><strong>FedRAMP®</strong>: Standardizes cloud service security assessment and monitoring for U.S. government use.</li>
    <li><strong>Center for Internet Security (CIS®)</strong>: Provides best-practice security controls to safeguard systems and networks.</li>
    <li><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>: E.U. law protecting personal data and privacy. Organizations must notify affected individuals within 72 hours of a data breach.</li>
    <li><strong>PCI DSS</strong>: International standard ensuring secure handling of credit card information.</li>
    <li><strong>HIPAA</strong>: U.S. law protecting patients’ health information, supported by three main rules—Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification—and assisted by the HITRUST® framework.</li>
    <li><strong>ISO</strong>: International Organization for Standardization sets cross-border standards in technology, planning, and process management.</li>
    <li><strong>SOC 1 & SOC 2</strong>: AICPA standards assessing user access, data safety, and organizational risk across employee and vendor roles.</li>
    <li><strong>Executive Order 14028</strong>: U.S. directive aimed at improving national cybersecurity, particularly in federal agencies and critical infrastructure.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Regulations evolve frequently. Consider researching additional regulations such as the <em>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</em> and the <em>Sarbanes-Oxley Act</em> to stay current.</p>

  <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
  <p>Controls, frameworks, and compliance form the backbone of an organization's security posture. As a security analyst, staying current with frameworks and regulatory changes is essential to protecting both organizations and the people they serve.</p>

  </div>




   <div class="glow-box" id="n">
  <h2>Ethics in Cybersecurity</h2>

  <p>Ethics in cybersecurity guide professionals to make the right decisions when facing security incidents, even when the choices are not clear-cut. As a security analyst, maintaining integrity, confidentiality, and adherence to policies is crucial, regardless of personal relationships or temptations.</p>

  <h3>Ethical Responsibilities of Security Professionals</h3>
  <p>Security professionals often have privileged access to sensitive data and systems. This access comes with the ethical duty to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remain unbiased and objective when investigating incidents.</li>
    <li>Protect confidentiality and avoid misuse of sensitive information.</li>
    <li>Follow organizational policies and protocols without favoritism.</li>
    <li>Avoid abusing access privileges, such as self-granting raises or unauthorized data access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Ethical Principles in Cybersecurity</h3>

  <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
  <p>Confidentiality means safeguarding proprietary and private information, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Security professionals must ensure this data is not disclosed inappropriately. For example, granting system access to coworkers outside of official channels is unethical and may result in severe consequences.</p>

  <h4>Privacy Protections</h4>
  <p>Privacy involves protecting personal information from unauthorized use. Security staff must adhere strictly to company policies regarding data access and sharing. Even when pressured, such as receiving after-hours requests for employee information, the correct response is to follow documented procedures, not circumvent them.</p>

  <h4>Laws and Compliance</h4>
  <p>Legal obligations are a fundamental part of cybersecurity ethics. Negligence or failure to protect sensitive data can lead to violations of compliance regulations and legal penalties. For example, leaving confidential patient files unattended is both unethical and illegal, risking data loss and reputational damage.</p>

  <h3>Why Ethics Matter in Cybersecurity</h3>
  <p>As technologies evolve and threats become more sophisticated, ethical decision-making ensures security professionals respond appropriately and protect organizational and individual interests. A strong ethical foundation helps maintain trust, uphold security standards, and navigate complex situations with integrity.</p>
  </div>




   <div class="glow-box" id="n">
      <h2>Ethical Concepts That Guide Cybersecurity Decisions</h2> 
     <p>Building on the foundation of security ethics, cybersecurity professionals must use ethical principles to make informed and responsible decisions. Ethics help ensure that actions taken to protect organizations and people are legal, fair, and effective in the face of evolving threats.</p> 
     <h3>Ethical Concerns and Laws Around Counterattacks</h3> 
     <h4>United States Standpoint</h4> 
     <p>In the U.S., launching counterattacks against threat actors is illegal under laws such as the <em>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1986)</em> and the <em>Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (2015)</em>. Only defensive actions are legally permitted. Counterattacks are viewed as vigilantism—unauthorized attempts to enforce the law—which can escalate conflicts, cause additional harm, and have severe consequences, especially if the attacker is a state-sponsored hacktivist. Only approved federal or military personnel can conduct counterattacks.</p> 
     <h4>International Standpoint</h4> 
     <p>The <em>International Court of Justice (ICJ)</em> permits counterattacks only under strict conditions:</p> 
     <ul> 
       <li>The counterattack affects only the original attacker.</li> 
       <li>It serves as a direct communication demanding the attacker stop.</li> 
       <li>It does not escalate the conflict.</li> 
       <li>Its effects can be reversed.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>Because these conditions are difficult to verify, organizations generally avoid counterattacks due to legal ambiguity and the risk of worsening the situation. 
     <h3>Core Ethical Principles and Methodologies</h3> 
       <p>Since counterattacks are mostly disallowed or illegal, cybersecurity relies on frameworks such as the <strong>CIA triad</strong> to address ethical obligations. These include:</p> 
     <h4>Confidentiality</h4> 
     <p>Ensuring that only authorized users access sensitive data. Ethically, this means respecting privacy and safeguarding private assets.</p> 
     <h4>Privacy Protection</h4> 
     <p>Protecting personal information—including <strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong> and <strong>Sensitive PII (SPII)</strong>—from unauthorized use. Security professionals have an ethical duty to secure such data, identify vulnerabilities, manage risks, and align security efforts with organizational goals.</p> 
     <h4>Laws and Legal Compliance</h4> 
     <p>Cybersecurity professionals must:</p> 
     <ul> 
       <li>Remain unbiased and honest in their work.</li> 
       <li>Respect and uphold laws applicable to data and security.</li>
       <li>Be transparent, evidence-based, and just in decision-making.</li>

  <h3>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools</h3>
  <p>SIEM tools collect and analyze log data from various systems in real time, allowing security analysts to monitor for critical activities and detect potential breaches. They reduce data overload by generating alerts based on specific risks or threats.</p>

  <h4>Examples of SIEM Tools</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Splunk Enterprise:</strong> A self-hosted data analysis platform used to retain, search, and analyze organizational log data.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Chronicle:</strong> A cloud-native SIEM tool that supports fast feature delivery and enables scalable search and analysis of security data.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>SIEM tools allow analysts to analyze patterns, conduct incident investigations, and proactively hunt for threats. Though implementations may vary across organizations, the core goal is to minimize risk through informed data monitoring and response.</p>

  <h3>Playbooks</h3>
  <p>Playbooks are operational manuals detailing how to respond to incidents and conduct procedures like security reviews or access management. These documents help ensure consistency in how incidents are handled before, during, and after they occur. Each organization may tailor their playbooks to fit specific needs and workflows.</p>

  <h3>Network Protocol Analyzers (Packet Sniffers)</h3>
  <p>These tools capture and analyze network traffic to identify suspicious or unauthorized activity. They are essential for assessing data movement within a network.</p>

  <h4>Examples of Network Protocol Analyzers</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>tcpdump:</strong> A command-line packet analyzer for capturing and inspecting network traffic.</li>
    <li><strong>Wireshark:</strong> A graphical tool used to analyze network traffic and troubleshoot security issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Entry-level analysts are not expected to master these tools immediately, but continued hands-on experience builds proficiency and strengthens risk mitigation capabilities over time.</p>

  </div>

These tools record data encountered by computers on a network, allowing analysts to assess traffic patterns and detect irregularities. Common tools in this category will be explored in practice sessions later in training.</p>

  <h3>Playbooks</h3>
  <p>Playbooks are manuals detailing how to handle specific operational or security-related tasks. They help ensure analysts follow consistent protocols across different scenarios. Every organization has unique playbooks, but they all serve the purpose of guiding structured and reliable responses to incidents.</p>

  <h4>Example Use Case</h4>
  <p>Consider a forensic investigation following a breach at a medical practice. As an analyst, your role involves collecting evidence and supporting an insurance claim. Playbooks would guide each step of this investigation to ensure accuracy and protocol adherence.</p>

  <h4>Chain of Custody Playbook</h4>
  <p>This playbook documents the possession and handling of digital evidence throughout an incident lifecycle. It records who had access to what evidence, when, and why. Maintaining a secure chain of custody ensures that the evidence is credible and admissible in legal or regulatory reviews.</p>

  <h4>Protecting and Preserving Evidence Playbook</h4>
  <p>This playbook outlines how to handle fragile digital evidence, especially volatile data that can be lost when a device powers off. Analysts must preserve this data using proper procedures, such as copying evidence before analysis. Failure to follow these steps can result in compromised evidence that is no longer valid.</p>

  <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
  <p>Security analysts must understand and effectively use tools like SIEM platforms, packet sniffers, and playbooks to protect operations and respond to incidents. While only two forensic playbooks were covered—chain of custody and protecting/preserving evidence—they form a crucial foundation for investigations. Further exploration of forensic practices and tools is recommended for those interested in this career path.</p>

Understanding tools like Linux, SQL, and Python is essential for performing technical security tasks with accuracy and speed.</p>

  <h3>Linux</h3>
  <p>Linux is an open-source operating system that uses a command-line interface for user interaction. Unlike graphical operating systems like Windows or MacOS, Linux relies on text-based commands to execute operations. While not a programming language, Linux enables analysts to examine system logs and interact directly with the system’s architecture.</p>

  <p>For example, entry-level analysts might use Linux commands to review error logs during an investigation of unusual network activity. Mastery of the Linux command line is a key skill for analyzing logs and managing system-level tasks efficiently.</p>

  <h3>SQL (Structured Query Language)</h3>
  <p>SQL is used to interact with and extract information from databases. These databases can hold millions of data points, and SQL allows analysts to filter, query, and retrieve specific entries relevant to a security investigation. By writing efficient SQL queries, analysts can locate crucial evidence or indicators of compromise within massive datasets.</p>

  <h3>Python</h3>
  <p>Python is a powerful, high-level programming language used to automate repetitive and time-consuming security tasks. It allows for rapid development of scripts and tools that help detect anomalies, process logs, or even simulate attacks for testing purposes. Analysts rely on Python for its readability, versatility, and robust library support.</p>

  <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
  <p>As a future security analyst, it’s important to understand that each organization’s toolkit may differ. Familiarity with Linux, SQL, and Python demonstrates your ability to learn new tools and adapt to the specific needs of an organization.

You'll explore Linux in greater detail later in the program, including its kernel and the GNU components that support it.</p>

  <h3>Web Vulnerabilities</h3>
  <p>Web vulnerabilities are flaws in web applications that can be exploited by threat actors to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or deploy malware. Staying updated with common vulnerabilities is critical. The <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OWASP Top 10</a> is a key resource for understanding current web application security risks.</p>

  <h3>Antivirus Software</h3>
  <p>Antivirus, or anti-malware software, detects, prevents, and removes malicious software. These tools scan system memory for patterns associated with malware and help protect against infections that can compromise system integrity.</p>

  <h3>Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</h3>
  <p>An IDS monitors network traffic for suspicious behavior or unauthorized access attempts. By analyzing packets of data moving through the network, an IDS can alert analysts to potential threats such as intrusions or data theft.</p>

  <h3>Encryption</h3>
  <p>Encryption protects the confidentiality of data by converting readable information (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext). This ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be understood by unauthorized users. Encryption differs from encoding, which uses public algorithms to allow different systems to share information without focusing on security.</p>

  <h3>Penetration Testing</h3>
  <p>Penetration testing, or pen testing, is a simulated cyberattack conducted to identify vulnerabilities in systems, applications, or processes. Pen testing evaluates both internal and external threats, helping organizations strengthen their defenses before real attacks occur.</p>
