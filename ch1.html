      <h2>Past Cybersecurity Attacks</h2>
  <p>Let me know if we have any questions about this material. I'm here to help!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Overview:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The security industry is constantly evolving, but many present-day attacks are adaptations of earlier methods.</li>
        <li>Understanding past attacks helps security analysts investigate and handle incidents effectively.</li>
        <li>A <em>computer virus</em> is malicious code designed to disrupt computer operations and damage data/software.</li>
        <li>Viruses attach to programs or documents and spread across computers in a network.</li>
        <li>Today, viruses are often called <em>malware</em>, which broadly means software designed to harm devices or networks.</li>
        <li>Two early malware examples are the <strong>Brain virus</strong> and the <strong>Morris worm</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The Brain Virus (1986):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Created by the Alvi brothers to track illegal medical software copies and prevent piracy.</li>
        <li>Instead of just tracking, it infected computers using pirated software.</li>
        <li>Infection spread through any disk inserted into an infected computer, rapidly spreading globally.</li>
        <li>Although it did not aim to destroy data or hardware, it slowed productivity and impacted business operations.</li>
        <li>This virus emphasized the need for security plans to maintain data safety and productivity.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The Morris Worm (1988):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed by Robert Morris to assess the size of the internet by installing itself on connected computers.</li>
        <li>The worm failed to track compromised computers and kept reinstalling itself, causing crashes due to memory exhaustion.</li>
        <li>About 6,000 computers (10% of the internet then) oure affected.</li>
        <li>The attack caused millions in damages from business disruption and removal efforts.</li>
        <li>Resulted in the creation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs®), which respond to security incidents.</li>
        <li>CERTs have since expanded responsibilities in the security industry.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Summary:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Early attacks like these shaped current cybersecurity strategies.</li>
        <li>Later topics in this program will cover the evolution of attacks in the digital age and hands-on detection and response skills.</li>

  <div class="glow-box" id="n">
      <h2>Attacks in the Digital Age</h2>
  <p>Let me know if we have any questions about this material. I'm here to help!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet Expansion and Malware Spread:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>With reliable high-speed internet, the number of connected computers increased dramatically.</li>
        <li>Malware no longer needed physical disks to spread; it could propagate through the internet.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Notable Internet-Based Attacks:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>LoveLetter Attack (2000):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Created by Onel De Guzman to steal internet login credentials.</li>
            <li>Spread rapidly by exploiting users' lack of suspicion toward unsolicited emails.</li>
            <li>Emails had subject line "I Love we" with an attachment "Love Letter For we."</li>
            <li>Opening the attachment caused the malware to scan the user’s address book and send itself to all contacts.</li>
            <li>Installed a program to collect user info and passwords.</li>
            <li>Infected 45 million computers globally, causing over $10 billion in damages.</li>
            <li>First notable example of <em>social engineering</em>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>A manipulation technique exploiting human error to gain private info, access, or valuables.</li>
            <li>After LoveLetter, attackers increasingly used social engineering.</li>
            <li>Rise of social media apps increased data accessibility and user vulnerability.</li>
            <li>Many prioritize convenience over privacy, leading to increased security risks.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

            <li>Identify and manage inappropriate technology use that risks the organization.</li>
            <li>Conduct and participate in regular internal trainings to raise awareness.</li>
            <li>Employees commonly receive training to recognize social engineering attacks, especially phishing emails.</li>
            <li><em>Phishing</em> uses digital communications to trick individuals into revealing sensitive data or deploying malware.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Equifax Breach (2017):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Attackers infiltrated credit reporting agency Equifax.</li>
            <li>Stole over 143 million customer records, affecting ~40% of Americans.</li>
            <li>Compromised data included social security numbers, birth dates, driver’s license numbers, home addresses, credit card numbers.</li>
            <li>Breach resulted from multiple unpatched vulnerabilities ignored by Equifax.</li>
            <li>Equifax settled with the U.S. government, paying over $575 million for complaints and fines.</li>
            <li>This major settlement highlighted the financial consequences of breaches and emphasized preventative measures.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <h2>Common Attacks and Their Effectiveness</h2>
  <p>Previously, we learned about past and present attacks that helped shape the cybersecurity industry, including the LoveLetter attack (ILOVEwe virus) and the Morris worm. The establishment of response teams, now called computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), was one outcome. In this reading, we will learn about common attack methods. Familiarity with these and evolving tactics will help we protect organizations and people.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Phishing:</strong> The use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Business Email Compromise (BEC):</strong> Threat actor sends an email seeming to come from a known source, requesting information to gain financial advantage.</li>
        <li><strong>Spear phishing:</strong> Targeted malicious email attack on specific user(s) appearing from a trusted source.</li>
        <li><strong>Whaling:</strong> Spear phishing targeting company executives to access sensitive data.</li>

      <h2>Introduction to the Eight CISSP Security Domains</h2>

  <p>Understanding core security concepts organized into security domains supports our growth as a security professional. CISSP defines eight interrelated domains that cover the work security professionals do. Gaps in any domain can impact an entire organization. Knowing these domains can help we identify career paths and our role within an organization.</p>

  <h3>Part 1: First Four Domains</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Security and Risk Management</strong><br />
      Focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and law. For example, updating company policies for federal compliance like HIPAA.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Asset Security</strong><br />
      Securing digital and physical assets including storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data. Tasks include proper disposal of old equipment containing confidential info.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Security Architecture and Engineering</strong><br />
      Optimizing data security through effective tools, systems, and processes. Example task: configuring firewalls to monitor and filter network traffic to prevent attacks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Communication and Network Security</strong><br />
      Managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. For instance, creating network policies to prevent users connecting to unsecured wireless hotspots.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Security is a team effort. As an entry-level analyst, we’ll develop skills to mitigate risks and keep people and data safe. we don’t need to be an expert in all domains, but a basic understanding is essential.</p>

  <h3>Part 2: Last Four Domains</h3>
  <ol start="5">
    <li>
      <strong>Identity and Access Management</strong><br />
      Ensuring users follow policies controlling physical assets (e.g., office access) and logical assets (networks, applications). Example: setting up employees’ keycard access.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Security Assessment and Testing</strong><br />
      Conducting security control testing, audits, and analyzing data to monitor risks and vulnerabilities. For example, auditing user permissions to prevent unauthorized access to payroll info.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Security Operations</strong><br />
      Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures. Example: responding to alerts about unknown devices on the internal network per organizational policies.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Software Development Security</strong><br />
      Using secure coding practices to create secure applications and services. Collaborating with development teams to ensure security in software life cycle, e.g., advising on password policies.
    </li>
  </ol>

      <h2>Understand Attackers</h2>

  <p>Previously, we oure introduced to the concept of threat actors. A threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk. In this reading, we’ll learn about different types of threat actors, their motivations, intentions, and how they’ve influenced the security industry.</p>

  <h3>Threat Actor Types</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)</strong><br />
      APTs have significant expertise to access an organization's network without authorization. They research their targets in advance and can remain undetected for long periods. Their motivations include:<br />
      - Damaging critical infrastructure like poour grids and natural resources<br />
      - Gaining access to intellectual property such as trade secrets or patents
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Insider Threats</strong><br />
      These actors abuse authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their motivations include:<br />
      - Sabotage<br />
      - Corruption<br />
      - Espionage<br />
      - Unauthorized data access or leaks
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Hacktivists</strong><br />
      Driven by political agendas, they use digital technology to achieve goals such as:<br />
      - Demonstrations<br />
      - Propaganda<br />
      - Social change campaigns<br />
      - Fame
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Hacker Types</h3>
  <p><em>A hacker is any person who uses computers to gain access to systems, networks, or data. They range from beginners to advanced professionals and have various motivations.</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Authorized Hackers (Ethical Hackers)</strong><br />
      Follow codes of ethics and laws to conduct risk evaluations. Motivated to protect people and organizations from malicious actors.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Semi-Authorized Hackers (Researchers)</strong><br />
      Search for vulnerabilities but do not exploit them.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Unauthorized Hackers (Unethical Hackers)</strong><br />
      Malicious actors who break laws to steal and sell confidential data for financial gain.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Other hacker types include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>New and unskilled threat actors who seek to learn, seek revenge, or exploit security weaknesses using existing tools and malware.</li>
    <li>Contract hackers who may be ethical or unethical depending on their tasks.</li>
    <li>Vigilante hackers aiming to protect the world from unethical hackers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
  <p>Threat actors are defined by malicious intent, while hackers are defined by their technical skills and motivations. Understanding these aspects helps we prepare to protect our organization and its people from malicious attacks.</p>
